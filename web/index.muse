* Introduction

Cistrome is a set of cis-acting targets of a trans-acting factor on a
genome scale. Technologies such as Chromatin immunoprecipitation
combined with microarray "ChIP-on-chip" or high throughput sequencing
have greatly facilitated the definition of the cistrome of
transcription factors and other Chromatin associated proteins.

This database contains both data sets and analysis tools which can be
used inside of DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE.
